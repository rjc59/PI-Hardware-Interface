Read wikipedia on the following for next week:
    system design doc
    working agreement
    system requirement spec

The paper must be 4 pages or more in length, using a relatively standard font and point size (e.g., 12-point Times New Roman or Computer Modern). Judicious use of charts, graphs, and/or illustrations is encouraged, especially if it helps me to udnerstand the . Margins should be of standard size (1" or less).

Please ensure that your name as well as the name of the project you worked on is listed, along with the name of the customer.

This is a group project - only one proposal paper is expected from each group.

In general, what I would like to see is a good understanding of what you are planning to do, why, and how. This may also include division of labor (for example, if one student is going to focus on quality assurance and two others on development, or one student is going to focus on documentation, etc.) All of this is subject to change as the semester goes on!

Here are some example questions I would like to see answered. This does not mean that you need answer all of them, but I would recommend that you think about all of them now so you are not blindsided later.
