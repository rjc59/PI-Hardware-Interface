Read wikipedia on the following for next week:
    system design doc
    working agreement
    system requirement spec

The paper must be 4 pages or more in length, using a relatively standard font and point size (e.g., 12-point Times New Roman or Computer Modern). Judicious use of charts, graphs, and/or illustrations is encouraged, especially if it helps me to udnerstand the . Margins should be of standard size (1" or less).

In general, what I would like to see is a good understanding of what you are planning to do, why, and how. This may also include division of labor (for example, if one student is going to focus on quality assurance and two others on development, or one student is going to focus on documentation, etc.) All of this is subject to change as the semester goes on!


Project: 
    Hardware/Software Interface

Team:
    Eric Hochendoner
    Andrew Panzl
    Rob Colleran

Customer:
    Don Bullock


What we are planning to do:
    Develop a platform which can be used to control a motorized mirror.

Why are we planning to do it:
    To develop a better understanding of how software interfaces with hardware devices.

How are we planning to do it:
    By designing a web interface for user input which will connect to motor drivers.

suggested questions:
    1 slack/email/google hangout/in person
    2 python
    3 whatever we need
    4 unit tests + manual integration tests
    5 client/server
    6 Hardware drivers / web interface / stuff in the middle
    7 pi, motors, 
    8 this class is in development, so there may be some issues
        Don will also intentionally withhold supplies and information to simulate a real world project
    9 probably Raspbian because its easiest
    10 once weekly in person, much more frequently digitally

User Stories:
    As a hardware developer
    I want an up-to-date working emulator
    So that I can continue developing my hardware while the software is being developed
    
    As a gyroscope
    I want to be 'balanced' after accelerometer inputs from the logical engine
    So that I can function properly as a gyroscope upon updates
    
    As a debugger
    I want the logic engine to log all operations
    So that I can review performance and isolate errors
    
    As a user of the web interface
    I want to be able to download all log files
    So that I can remotely debug the logic engine
    
    As a software developer
    I want API endpoints for all functions
    So that I can stream instructions to the driver
    
    As a hardware developer
    I want all net motions to be limited to 90 degrees
    So that the hardware stays within safe limits
    
    As a $FOO
    I want $BAR
    So that $BAZ
