Intro:
  Project information:
  - The task for this project is to develop software that can interface with a hardware device consisting of a raspberry pi
  that controls various components. These components could include a gyroscope, temperature sensor, motors, or other peripherals.
  - This hardware will not always be available for testing and its exact specifications may be changed by the POC over time,
  therefore hardware will need to be simulated during development.
  - The software to be developed should include a web server/client interface to communicate with the software controlling
  the hardware, lower level software for the pi that controls the hardware, and a driver to simulate the hardware.
  - As part of the server/client interface, networking code will be needed to handle
  communication over the bus between the server and client and handle problems such as communication errors and race conditions.
  - In addition to the software, documentation will need to be done. This will include a system design document, system requirement specification, a working agreement, etc.
  - It will also be necessary to do quality assurance (QA) work
  Document scope:
  - The scope for this project includes all development, testing, and documentation for:
  The web server/client interface to communicate with the software controlling the hardware
  the lower level software for the pi that controls the hardware
  the driver to simulate the hardware
  the networking code to handle communication between the server and client
  - It does not include:
  Any development or work on the hardware itself

Deliverables:
  Kickoff -
    Dev team will work with POC to understand requirements of the project and develop documentation
  Design Phase -
    Dev team will make detailed design decisions, make a working agreement, research the required hardware/libraries, and write skeleton code
  Build Phase -
    Dev team will complete all coding of hardware drivers, and enough coding of an interface and communication software that testing on hardware is possible
    Hardware simulator will also be developed during this period to prepare for hardware testing
    All code will be thoroughly tested and a working beta will be available in the master branch of the repository
    A testing report will be compiled
    Team will meet weekly to give status updates to each other and to the POC
  Implementation Phase -
    Software will be implemented on the pi and hardware-specific details will be worked out, including inverting of the wifi adapter etc
    The interface will be updated to handle hardware-specific details that the simulator couldn't provide, such as certain alerts etc
    Testing will be done in conjunction with the hardware
  Finalization Phase -
    A user manual will be created
    Requirements checklist will be completed
    All previous documents will be updated to reflect the final status of the project
    Final report detailing development will be written

Working period:
  Work will take place from Jan 19th to April 20th 2018
  Meetings every week, sprints every 2 weeks

Communications:
  - Slack will be used to communicate about development and with POC
  - Weekly in-person meetings with POC
  Client feedback:
  - TODO
Acceptance Criteria:
  - The POC will be in charge of declaring if work is acceptable or not
  - At each meeting, documentation and software in master branch will be reviewed and he will declare if scheduled requirements and scope of work have been met
